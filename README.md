# FinalProject

This game is a 3D FPS game, styled after the the indie game "Enter The Gungeon". To play the game, just launch the program "finalProject_ofDebug.exe", and it loads you right into the game.

To play, use WASD for movement, and the mouse for aiming, scoping(right click), and shooting(left click). There is no jump, but instead a dodge roll(spacebar) that lets you jump across pits, and also through bullets without taking damage.

Walking into a room causes the enemies in that room to spawn, and the room locks. The enemies shoot forward without moving. Shoot the enemmies enough and they will die, and once all the enemies in the room are dead the room unlocks and you can progress to the next room.

You start with 6 health, in 3 full hearts. If you take fall into a pit or get hit by a bullet, you take half a heart of damage, and when you lose all your health the game exits.

You win by clearing all the enemies in the "boss room". It's not labelled, but has the most enemies. The room immediately after that has the elevator, which you walk in to and win the game, also triggering an exit.
