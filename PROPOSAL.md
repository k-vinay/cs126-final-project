# Project Proposal

For my project, I will be creating a first person shooter videogame.

The project will involve several aspects, the most important being rendering in 3d. This will involve loading 3d models, finding code representations of them, and displaying them in an openFrameworks application. openFrameworks has a library for 3d rendering, for which the documentation can be found [here](https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/3d/).

Another aspects of the projects is making the models themselves. Making the models would probably involve a 3d modeling program, and possibly another external resource to convert the 3d models to meshes that can be modelled by openFrameworks, depending on how the ofMesh class works. Since the game is first person, there wouldnâ€™t need to be a player model, but some sort of HUD including a gun, health, etc.

The game will also include multiple levels, each of which get progressively more difficult, and possibly a tutorial section. Each level would consist of a map, and enemies scattered throughout. There may be different types of enemies included (not decided yet). There would also be an objective, which will most likely be to either progress through the map to a certain location or to defeat all the enemies in the level.

Much of the programming for this project, apart from the rendering, would be for the player control behaviors, and also for enemy behavior. This would also include interactions with the world and enemies, and possibly additional objects as well.

The design and style of the enemies and levels is yet to be decided, but I am currently thinking something along the lines of Doom (although obviously much simpler).
